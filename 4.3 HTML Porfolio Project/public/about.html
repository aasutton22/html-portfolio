<h1>About Me</h1>

<img src="../assets/images/pandaman.jpeg" height="250"/>

<p>Hello! My name is Austin Sutton, I'm currently 25 years old, and I am an aspiring Web Developer! My hobbies include playing video games, playing Pokemon GO, going to music festivals, and going on walks. I have been working for Amazon as a Warehouse Associate for about 6 and a half years now. I am currently learning the ins and outs of web development through "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. I am still very new to this so everything in my portfolio as of right now will look extremely basic, but I believe I will improve very quickly.</p>
