<p>Hello! My name is Austin Sutton. I am 26 years old, I live in Illinois, and I currently work at an Amazon warehouse. Welcome to my portfolio! I know it is extremely basic at the moment, but bare with me. I have just started my web development journey, but so far I am loving it, and I can't wait to learn some more advanced coding so I can make this portfolio look all shiny and fancy! Anyway, my hobbies include playing video games on my PC and Switch, playing Pokemon GO, going to raves/music festivals with my friends, and (until i can turn it into a career) coding! I'm thrilled to be on this journey, and can't wait to share all of my progress with you. I plan on putting all of my projects on here, from the extremely basic html only pages, to the full blown, fully operational pages.</p>
